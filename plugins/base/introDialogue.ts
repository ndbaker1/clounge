            <h3>Welcome to ðŸ§‚ <u>tablesalt</u>, a peer-to-peer tabletop.</h3>

            The first thing you'll probably want to do is share your room with others.  
            Click the "Share Lobby" button in the top-right and then send the link to your friends!
            Don't forget to set a name for yourself in the top-left, which is what others will see next to your cursor.

            <br/> <br/>

            In order to load objects into the room, press the "Load Objects" button in the top-right.
            It will prompt you for a descriptor JSON, which is going to be an array of objects with required and optional properties.
            It may help to visit the
            <a
                href="https://github.com/ndbaker1/tablesalt/blob/main/plugins/base/objectLoader.ts#L10"
                target="_blank noreferrer"
            >JSON example</a>
            in the app's source code for reference.

            <br/> <br/>

            Once objects are loaded into the room you can drag them around and right-click to perform additional actions.
            There are some default controls and shortcuts built-in already, such as:

            <ul>
                <li>hold <kbd>middle-click</kbd> and drag to pan around</li>
                <li>hover an object and press <kbd>f</kbd> to flip it over</li>
                <li>hover an object and press <kbd>space</kbd> to view a close-up of it</li>
                <li>hover over objects and press <kbd>ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>left-click</kbd> to open up the preview menu</li>
                <li>hold <kbd>shift</kbd> and drag to move every object under the cursor</li>
            </ul>

            Lots of things may change as it's still very much a work in progress,
            so don't be surprised by the amount of bugs and bad UI design choices :)

            Regardless, thanks for trying out tablesalt!
