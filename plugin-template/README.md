# Plugin Template

## Development ðŸ”¨

Setup the template by running:

```bash
npm install
```

Then edit [plugin.ts](./plugin.ts) with plugin logic while utilizing types from the `clounge` library core.

## Build 
To build the plugin, run the npm script:

```bash
npm run package
```

This will output a Javascript module at `build/plugin.js`, which you can upload to any file hosting service and provide its URI for the app to load.

> You could go ahead and just commit this `build` directory if you want to use github raw file links as your plugin URL
